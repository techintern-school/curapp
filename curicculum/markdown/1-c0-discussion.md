> Discussion: Why are we learning to use a spreadsheet in a software engineering course? If you have never programmed before, spreadsheets are a great way to visualize programming concepts. Even if you have programmed before, writing code isn’t always the simplest solution. Working with the data in the spreadsheet has the advantage of being able to quickly see all of the values in the columns. Did you notice that some of the values in the brand field said Nike and others nike? We accepted your solution without validating the second case, but don’t worry. We will be coming back to clean this up in a later problem.

> Let’s quickly recap the steps we performed to solve this problem:

> - Imported the csv file in the spreadsheet application (programming environment)
> - Filtered the rows of data to just the ones we needed (Nike/Shoes)
> - Applied the transformation (discount current price by 20%)
> - Exported the csv file out of the spreadsheet application (programming environment)

> Note that we are calling the spreadsheet application a programming environment. You had to write a formula (function) to discount the prices. You clicked the buttons in the spreadsheet to solve this problem and solve it much quicker than you could have if you had to program. Especially if you have never programmed before.

> Fast is great, but does that mean there is no need to program a solution? The short answer is it depends. It depends on the requirements. It depends on how often you need to solve a particular problem. If you never had to do this again, it would be overkill to write a program to do something that you could quickly do in a spreadsheet.

> What’s that? We need to apply hundreds of these price changes like this a week? Time to write an automated program to help do it.
