## Project 0: New Hire Onboarding

#### **ISE Intro:**

```
When you start a new job, your first few days are spent learning about the tools and systems a company uses. Your first project at O&O will guide you through setting up your Mac OS computer. It will introduce you to some of the tools you will need to learn to start creating software. If you come across terms you don’t know, google them. If you still have questions about the meaning of a term or something isn’t clear, you will be able to file an issue after you have created your account by following the instructions below.

If you are working on another operating system (i.e. Windows/Linux) or run into error messages during the installation, please reach out to geoff@techIntern.school for help getting started.

In this project we will introduce several tools that will help you create software. We will start installing software from the command line. This is an alternative to downloading software by clicking on a link with your mouse. Using tools like homebrew and npm, you will learn how to access to hundreds of thousands of pieces of open source software. This software will help you start developing your own software.

The command line is a way to interact with your operating system using text commands. You are already familiar with clicking on your operating system's Graphic User Interface (GUI), but may not have seen the Command Line Interface the operating system exposes through the MacOS terminal application. If you haven't worked in the terminal before, [here is a link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/conquering-the-command-line-f85f5e46c07c/) to an introductory article. When you install many pieces of software, you download the text files that make up the source code of the program. These files are saved in your file system in a folder (Applications/Downloads/...).

The software you install using the command line can usually be launched from the command line. This gives you the ability to combine two or more applications to help solve a problem you are working on. The folder (directory) that you navigate in the Mac OS Finder application are the same directories that you see in the terminal. To start working on projects, you will have to learn the commands to move around the file system. You will also be introduced to tools like GitHub and a text editor.

GitHub is a platform for developers to share and collaborate on code. [This article](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/) provides a good overview. Beyond sharing code, GitHub provides other tools that help develop software. Github Issues help organize the work associated with a repository (repo). [This article](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) explains more about them. Pull requests help manage multiple people working on a single codebase, and makes it easier to review code for bugs before it is merged.

A text editor is similar to a word processor (Microsoft Word, Google Docs), but designed to write code files. The same commands you type into the terminal can also be saved in files and executed - this is called a script. This type of script is on of the building blocks of building software. A text editor can be used to write all kinds of computer programming languges. Including low level languages like C that power your operating system Mac OS, and higher level langugages that render web pages like JavaScript. The text editor we reccomend you [install is VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - stable macOS version.

You are now ready to start your first project. Good luck!

Welcome to O&O. This document will help you get oriented to the systems and tools we use. We will get your computer setup to start developing software in your next project.

The application you are reading this project on is called the web portal (WP). It is where you will learn about the projects you will work on, and find links to other resources you will need. Each project will have several challenges that we need you to complete. This project has three challenges. You will first create a Github account and use it to login to the web portal. You will then install the TIS command line interface using the terminal application. The last challenge will require learning more about the file system.
