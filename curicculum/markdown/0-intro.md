## Project 0: New Hire Onboarding

> ### **ISE Intro:**

> When you start a new job, your first few days are often spent learning about the tools and systems a company uses. Your first project at O&O will guide you through setting up your OSX computer. It will introduce you to some of the tools you will need to learn to start creating software. If you come across terms you don’t know, google them. If you still have questions about the meaning of a term or something isn’t clear, please file an issue using the button in the top right corner. If you have never filed a Github issue before, here is a quick tutorial.

> If you are working on another operating system (i.e. Windows/Linux) or run into error messages during the installation, please reach out to geoff@techIntern.school for help getting started.

Welcome to O&O. This document will help you get oriented to the systems and tools we use. We will get your computer setup to start developing software in your next project.

The application you are reading this project on is called the web portal (WP). It is where you will learn about the projects you will work on, and find links to other resources you will need. Each project will have several challenges that we need you to complete. Later in this project, your first challenge will be to download and install the command-line interface (CLI). This application will be used to submit your solutions to the rest of the challenges. There is also a backend service that runs on our servers to keep track of your progress and synchronizes the CLI and WP. Collectively these applications form the learning application. A high level architecture diagram of this system is below in figure 1.
