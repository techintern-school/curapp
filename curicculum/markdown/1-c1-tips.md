> This just got more complicated. We will need to learn a bunch of new skills and technologies to solve this problem. It will take a lot longer than the first problem we worked on, but it will be worth it.

> If you donâ€™t already know how to program in Python, now is the time to start learning. We recommend you use the [Python for Everyone free online course](https://www.py4e.com/). It has good video lectures, and provides a great introduction to programming. To solve this problem, you will likely need to watch lessons 1-9. There are optional practice exercises using the courses Autograder. These are not required but will help cement what you are learning, and will help you apply what you are learning to solve this problem for O&O.
