## New student welcome letter

Welcome to techIntern.school’s Introduction to Software Engineering (ISE). I know you have a lot of choices to learn to program online. Some courses focus on teaching a particular technology. Others explain concepts, then work through a series of practice problems in your browser. ISE takes a different approach. You will start working like a Software Engineer (SE) as we work through projects based on real business problems.

Software engineering is the art and occasional science of creating software. Not just any software. Your software must be easy to use and meet the requirements of your users. When you create software for your own use, you can define the requirments. When you are employeed as a software engineer, these requirements and constraints are usually given to you. The software you create will include code written by you, but it will be the minority. The majority of the software in your solutions will have been written by other people. This course will teach you how to develop your own software, and how to use third party software to make more reliable solutions.

Without prior software experience, ISE will take you at least 6 months of full time (40 hours/week) studying. It will take longer if you are studying part-time. If you want a certification you can add to your resume in six weeks, you should look elsewhere. If you want to learn to use software to solve problems, you are in the right place.

With some risk of oversimplifying things, you need five skills to become a professional SE.

#### Skill 1. Learn to get unstuck

A surprising percentage of the job of a SE is getting unstuck when you don’t understand something. Being stuck is not fun. The joy of solving a problem that had you stumped is fun for some people. I want you to figure out as soon as possible if you are one of the people who enjoys getting unstuck. If getting unstuck brings you joy, this is the right course for you to learn to become a SE. If not, you can still learn to become a SE, but I don’t recommend doing it here. There are other schools that put less emphasis on developing this skill.

We will start developing your unstucking skill right away in project 0 when we get your computer setup for ISE. We will develop it further when you start solving projects with programming. It will be challenging. Software engineering is challenging. All worthwhile things are. Without learning to get unstuck, you will have a hard time making progress on software projects.

ISE will provide links to resources that will help you develop solutions. ISE will not spoon feed you solutions. This is to prepare you for what your software engineering career will be like. As a junior software engineer, you will likely get help figuring out how to approach a problem. It will still be your responsibility to solve it. Solving problems takes practice. It takes time. It takes a lot of not completely understanding things, before they click.

As you develop your skills, the projects you will work on will get more challenging. I don’t expect you to complete all of these without help. techIntern.school (TIS) will assign your mentor after your first month of studying. Your mentor will be able to help you when you get stuck, but they are not your main source of help. You are. Your time with your mentor is valuable. You will be paying \$100/hour for it. Focus your conversations with your mentor more on high-level direction and less on low-level technical questions. If you are unclear what to do next, that is a good thing to discuss. If you don’t understand something, ask your mentor to point you in the direction of a resource that you can use to figure it out.

#### Skill 2. Learn the building blocks

The ISE curriculum does not revolve around learning to code. ISE will teach you software engineering. Software Engineering is not about knowing Computer Science trivia. Nor is it about memorizing syntax of programming languages. The primary goal of a professional SE is to solve problems that create business value. You may use programming syntax and CS knowledge as inputs to solve a problem, but they are not the output. The solution you create is the output.

Unless you are writing in machine code by hand, your software will include software written by others. These are your building blocks. Programming language features are building blocks. Text editors are building blocks. Open source software is a building block. Commercial software are heavily polished building blocks.

Learning what building blocks exist and how to use them is the next skill you need to develop. ISE projects will expose you to a broad foundation of knowledge and technologies. We won’t go too deep in many technologies. Especially at the beginning. Being able to name a piece of technology and know “it can do X and Y, but not Z” is what we are aiming for at this point. This will be the focus of the second part of the curriculum.

#### Skill 3. Learn to put the building blocks together

A single building block is not valuable to a business. Value comes from combining the building blocks in a way that solves the businesses’ end users’ problems. Given a problem, what building blocks will help solve it? How should you combine them? What are the tradeoffs of different solutions? Answering these questions is your core responsibility as a SE.

Our next set of projects will require combining the building blocks you have learned. You will keep learning new building blocks, but you are now responsible for understanding something else. How the building blocks relate to each other. This composition, and the thought process that goes into it is the next important skill you need to develop.

The projects you work on to develop this skill will have more challenging requirements. These are the types of projects you can put on your resume. They will also give you something to talk about with prospective employers.

#### Step 4. Learn to work in a team

Software engineering is rarely an individual exercise. When you are employed as a SE, you will work as part of a team. The final ISE projects will simulate parts of working in a team. Communication and teamwork are important soft skills you need to develope to being a successful software engineer. What you learn through ISE is no substitute for professional experience. Getting your first job as a professional SE is the next step you need to take.

Many companies look for internship experience in entry-level hires. It demonstrates the ability to apply what they have learned through their studies. It also provides you (the intern) with valuable skills that are difficult to get through self guided study. This course will prepare you to be an awesome intern. This will lead to your first full-time job as a software engineer.

TIS will give you the experience you need to get more experience.

#### Skill 5. Learn to be an expert

Becoming an expert requires experience. It requires practice. It requires developing your own perspective on a subject. Becoming an expert is out of scope for ISE, but will be your next challenge when you have started gaining experience. There are many specializations in software engineering. You can choose to become an expert in one or more of these domains. How much experience do you need to become an expert? We leave this as an exercise for the student to complete when you are ready.

### What is TIS?

I founded TIS in March 2020 to create the resource I wish I had when I was learning software engineer. You are the first students to go through the ISE course. The online learning platform is under active development. Despite some rough edges, what you will learn will be worth the growing pains. As a software engineer, you will often encounter bugs you didn’t expect when using other people’s software. To resolve the bug, you will have to figure out if the issue is with your software or theirs. During your studies, you can file a bug report at any time if you are not sure why things are not working. Filing good bug reports is an important skill you will need as a software engineer. Describing your bugs as features is another important skill, but I digress.

### What's next?

All of the projects you will work on in ISE will be for a fictional e-commerce company called onandon.com (O&O). O&O has decided to hire you to help develop software for their growing business. They know you don’t have much experience as a software engineer, and have structured your projects to build up your skills.

Enough talk. Let’s get to work.
