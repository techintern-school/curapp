Unlike the previous project, we will not give you the commands you need to run. You will need to figure this out by googling. You should get started by searching for "how to copy directory command line linux" in Google. It will be easier to test your script directly in the terminal in the `/project-0/challenge-2` directory. When you believe you have found the command you need, you can submit your solution by saving it in the `backup-products.sh` file and running `npm run submit` in `/project-0/challenge-2`.
