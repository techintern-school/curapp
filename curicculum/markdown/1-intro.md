## Project 1: Updating Product Catalog

> ### **ISE Intro:**

In this project, you will learn how to use Python to manipulate data. In the first challenge, you will solve the problem in a spreadsheet. If you have never used spreadsheet functions before, here is a good tutorial [TODO link]. Once we have solved that problem in the spreadsheet, we will move on to solving it with Python. If you havenâ€™t programmed before, you will likely spend at least a week on this project. The data we will be working with is stored as a csv in the project-1 directory of the project repository you downloaded in project 0. If you are unfamiliar with csv, here is a [quick explainer](https://www.howtogeek.com/348960/what-is-a-csv-file-and-how-do-i-open-it/).
