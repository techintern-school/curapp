If you come across terms you don’t know, google them. If you still have questions about the meaning of a term or something isn’t clear, you will be able to file an issue after you have created your account by following the instructions below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are working on another operating system (i.e. Windows/Linux) or run into error messages during the installation, please reach out to geoff@techIntern.school for help getting started.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The main tools we will be learning in this project are the command line and GitHub.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The command line is a way to interact with your operating system using text commands. You are already familiar with clicking on your operating system's Graphic User Interface (GUI), but may not have seen the Command Line Interface the operating system exposes through the MacOS terminal application. If you haven't worked in the terminal before, <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/conquering-the-command-line-f85f5e46c07c/\" target='_blank'> here is a link</a> to an introductory article. For a deeper analysis of Unix - the operating system that MacOS is based on - check out <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/context.html\" target='_blank'> this online book</a>. When you are entering commands into the terminal, you are writing in a language called bash. This <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Basic-Shell-Features.html#Basic-Shell-Features\" target='_blank'> reference manual</a> provides an overview of Bash features, but is not necessary to read now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GitHub is a platform for developers to share and collaborate on code. <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/\" target='_blank'> This article</a> provides a good overview. Beyond sharing code, GitHub provides other tools that help develop software. Github Issues help organize the work associated with a repository (repo). <a href=\"https://guides.github.com/features/issues/\" target='_blank'> This article</a> explains more about them. Pull requests help manage multiple people working on a single codebase, and makes it easier to review code for bugs before it is merged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Welcome to O&amp;O. This document will help you get oriented to the systems and tools we use.

It is where you will learn about the projects you will work on, and find links to other resources you will need. Each project will have several challenges that we need you to complete.

If you have never programmed before, spreadsheets are a great way to visualize programming concepts. Even if you have programmed before, writing code isn’t always the simplest solution. Working with the data in the spreadsheet has the advantage of being able to quickly see all of the values in the columns. Did you notice that some of the values in the brand field said Nike and others nike? We accepted your solution without validating the second case, but don’t worry.
